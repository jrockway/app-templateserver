        - fix the docs for instantiating a class with a custom method from data
        - make the code for that actually work (whoops; test added :)
        - bump required version of Moose

0.02    15 January 2008
        - docroot is an arrayref now
        - no need to specify provider as App::TemplateServer::Provider::,
          it's implied
        - unescape URI (server/foo%20bar.tt => "foo bar.tt")
        - add Null provider (for testing)

0.01    14 January 2008
        - very first version
          released upon the world
          with much rejoicing
